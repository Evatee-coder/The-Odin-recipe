    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <strong>Moin-Moin </strong>  or <strong> Moimoi </strong> is a savory steamed traditional Nigerian main dish made from a mixture of washed and peeled black-eyed beans, onions and fresh ground red peppers (usually a combination of bell peppers and chili or Scotch bonnet). It is a protein-rich food that is a staple in Nigeria. It is often served as lunch or dinner and most time we often warm the leftover in the morning and use it as a side paired with pap or custard.  </p>
    <p>In other west african countries such as Ghana and Sierra Leone, it is commonly known as "Alele" or "Olele". It is commonly seen accompanying Jollof Rice, Fried Rice, Fried Plantain, Custard, Akamu (Pap, Ogi) etc. It can even be eaten alone as a snack with a chilled soft drink to wash it down.    </p>
    <p>This delicious meal can be cooked in various ways . The most common method is cooking Moi Moi in bowls, Aluminium Foil Bags, Banana Leaves, Uma Leaves(Thaumatococcus Daniellii) or  in heat proof nylons.   </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Black-eyed Peas or Brown Beans</li>
            <li> Red Bell pepper/tatashe Medium size</li>
            <li> Habanero/Scotch Bonnet/Rodo or Tatashe </li>
            <li> 3/4 Cup Diced onion</li>
            <li> Tablespoons of Crayfish </li>
            <li> Lukewarm water (for mixing) </li>
            <li> 1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil </li>
            <li> Chicken bouillon Cubes</li>
            <li> Fish â€“ I like Mackerel or Salmon</li>
            <li> Hard-boiled Eggs</li>
            <li>  2 litres of cool or warm water</li>
            <li> Salt (to taste)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the Beans for 15 minutes depending on how dry your beans are. The drier beans tend to be ready for peeling faster than the less dried beans.  </li>
            <li>Pour the Beans in the Blender and add twice as much water as the Beans (by volume) blend the Beans for 3-4 seconds per time and repeat this 3 to 4 times - Remember we are peeling the beans and not blending them. </li>
            <li>Pour the beans back into a large bowl and add enough water to fully cover the Beans. Now agitate the Beans with your fingers and the skin will float then quickly separate the skin from the Beans by pouring through a sieve.</li>
            <li>Once that is done, pour the peeled Beans (the skinless Beans) inside a Blender, together with the Red Pepper, Habanero, and Onion - Blend to the smoothest consistency you can ever get.</li>
            <li>Combine the blended mixture with the remaining ingredients except for the boiled Eggs.</li>
            <li>Spray or brush the container you will be using with oil. Pour the mixture into the container and place the boiled egg over it. Cover it with a lid or seal with foil paper. </li>
            <li>Line the base of a large pot with either foil paper, sticks, leaves. Add enough water to the pot. (Add just enough not to submerge the moi moi bowls). This is to prevent the Moin moin from sticking to the base of the pot in case the water dries up before the moin moin gets done. </li>
            <li>Arrange the Moin moin inside the Pot and cook till done. This should take about 45 minutes to 1 hour a little more or less depending on the quantity of the Moin moin mixture in each container. </li>
            <li>To check for doneness, insert a toothpick into the middle of the Moin Moin/Moi. The toothpick should come out fairly clean and not wet. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve.</li>
        </ol>
    <p> That's how the Nigerian Moin-Moin is made. It can be eating with a garri, pap and many other combinations.chilled drink.</p>
