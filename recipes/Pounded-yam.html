        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong> Yam </strong>  – The type of Nigerian Yam we use is commonly referred to African yam. It has a dark brown rough skin with off-white flesh. They can be boiled, roasted, or fried.  </li>
                <li> <strong>Water  </strong> – water is the second ingredient and this is needed to boil the yam until it becomes fork-tender. </li>
                 <li> <strong> Mortar and Pestle</strong> – to pound the Yam until it becomes smooth and doughy.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the skins off the yams and slice them into about 1/2 inch thickness. </li>
                <li>Rinse and place the yams in a pot and add enough water to the level of the Yam. Rinse about once or twice till you get clear water. </li>
                <li>Cover and cook the yams for about 30 minutes, checking every 10 minutes or thereabout until the yams are fork tender.</li>
                <li>Pound or blend into a dough-like consistency until it’s completely smooth with no yam chunks left.</li>
                <li>The amount of water you will need to boil the yam will vary depending on how dry the yam is. Fresh yams in the early season of the harvest will take less water while yams harvested in the later season will require more water.</li>
                <li>This also applies during the pounding, you will need more water for the dry yam and less water for the less dry yams.</li>
            </ol>
